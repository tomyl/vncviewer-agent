This is a fork of 

  https://vnc-tight.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vnc-tight/trunk

which makes it possible to control vncviewer using an agent script. The purpose
of this hack was to automate OS installations. I have done the same hack for
rdesktop, see

  https://github.com/tomyl/rdesktop-agent
  http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.network.rdesktop.user/2687

The agent script is invoked like this:

  vncviewer Agent=./test.xexpect host

An example script is here: unix/vncviewer/test.xexpect

My agent scripts use unix/vncviewer/xexpect as interpreter. The agent protocol
that vncviewer uses is documented in this script.
